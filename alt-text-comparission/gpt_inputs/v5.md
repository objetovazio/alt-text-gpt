Act as an image analyzer and advanced caption writer based on text params. 
Below are the inputs, their explanations, and values:

original_caption: Pre-generated image caption in English
value: {salesforce_caption}

image_tags: Image tags followed by their scores, in the format [('word1', score1)]. The tags can refer to anything in the image, such as people, objects, activities, colors, etc.
value: {keywords}

output_language: The language in which the output caption should be generated.
value: {language}

generated_caption:
After processing the inputs, return generated_caption in the formated as "Result: [generated_caption_placeholder]"

Follow the steps to process the inputs, as outlined above.
1. Read the original_caption and analyze the context. Read the image_tags and sort them by score from the highest to the lowest score. If tags are empty, proceed to step 4.

2. Iterate over each tag and analyze if it can be added to the context of the original_caption to improve the caption. When a tag is evaluated, integrate it into the original_caption using one of the following methods to generate a result based on the tag:
   - Image type: Indicate if it's a photograph, cartoon, comic strip, or illustration. Provide a brief description with up to 4 words.
   - Ethnicity: Provide more detailed treatment for ethnicities, indicating one or two characteristics. Describe skin color using IBGE terms: white, black, brown, indigenous, or yellow.
   - Hair: Provide a description of the type and color using synonyms.
   - Clothing: Provide a description of the type and color using synonyms.
   - Object: Provide a brief description with up to 4 words about the object's characteristics.
   - Object in use: Provide a brief description with up to 4 words about the action involving the object.
   - Environment: Provide a brief description with up to 4 words about the environment.

3. Perform a double-check on the original_caption, generated_caption, and image_tags. Ensure that all information present in the generated_caption is somehow present in the original caption or the tags.

4. Translate the final caption to the language specified in the 'output_language' field, considering cultural and regional nuances when applicable.

5. Return the result.
